# A World With 0 Emissions

Imagine a world with no emissions. Is this even in the realm of possibility? And what does data science have to do with it?

Well, we dared to imagine.

We took data on coastal wilfires, EV production and current carbon footprint to analyze and understand the trend. Using modeling, we attempt to understand the relationship between these inputs and their weight on emissions.

## Problem Space

We are taking a regression problem and looking to predict, what carbon emissions might look like 5 years into the future.
